# Variables & Data Types

## Variables

* **Variables** are names used to refer to some location in memory - a location that holds a value.
  * Think of variables as boxes to store data in
* **Declaring** a variable brings the variable into existence
  * This amounts to creating the box to store the value in
  * But how does the computer know what size the box should be?
    * Not all data has the same size
    * The compiler uses the **type** of the data to determine how much memory is needed to store the variable
* All variables in C are typed
* **Initializing** a variable means you **assign** the variable a value when you declare it
* Some examples:

```c
int a; // declars a as an integer

int anumber, anothernumber, athirdnumber; // declares three variables, all of which are integers

int b = 5; // declares b as an int an initializes its value to 5

b = 10; // assigns b to have the value of 10

anumber = b; // assigns anumber to have the value of b, which is 10

anumber = anothernumber = athirdnumber = b; // assigns anumber, anothernumber, and athirdnumber to have the value of b, which is 10
```

### Naming variables

* Variable names are made up of letters (upper and lower case), digits, and the underscore character "_".
* Names cannot begin with a digit
* Some valid variable names:

```c
foo
Bar
BAZ
foo_bar
_foo42
_
QuUx
```

* Some invalid variable names:

```c
2foo    // must not begin with a digit
my foo  // spaces not allowed in names
$foo    // $ not allowed -- only letters, and _
while   // language keywords cannot be used as names
```

* You may only use the same variable **once** within the same variable scope

## Literals

* A value, literally
* `5` is a literal. `32.3` is a literal
* These are invariant values. They can never be changed. They can never store data.
* They are literally some value.

## Basic Data Types

* Four basic types:
    1. `int`
    2. `char`
    3. `float`
    4. `double`

### `int`

* Stores an integer value.
* Typically stored in 32 bits (the computer uses 32 bits to represent the number)
  * If you have a set of integers centered around 0, what's the maximum and minimum integer you can represent with 32-bits?
    * 32 bits leads to 4294967296 which is $2^{32}$ (binary is base 2, and we have 32 bits)
    * Maximum value: `+2147483647`
    * Minimum value: `-2147483648`
* Example usage:

```c
int a = 5;
```

### `char`

* Capable of holding any member of the character set.
* Stored in 1 byte (8 bits).
* The underlying structure has the same type of data as an `int` (with a smaller range of data)
  * However, we the way we _should_ use chars is not through integer references
  * This is all because internally a character is literally an integer to the computer
* Examples of characters:

```c
'a'
'b'
'3'
'\0'  // null character
'\n'  // newline character
'\t'  // tab character
```

* A **string literal** is a collection of characters in a single string
  * `"Hello, world!"` is an example of a string literal
  * String literals are denoted by " instead of ' for their wrapping quotations

### `float`

* Holds a floating point number, such as `32.2`
* All representations of floating point numbers are inexact.
* Adding `f` to the end of a number indicates it is to be interpreted as a float
* Examples of floats:

```c
32.3
3223.64563f
4.0f
6.022e+23f
```

### `double`

* Exact same as a `float`, but uses double the precision (i.e. double the computer memory) to store the data

## `sizeof`

* If you need to know the exact size of a variable, you can use `sizeof` (a unary operator) to find out:

```c
sizeof(type)
sizeof obj
```

* This returns the size of the underlying type specified
* The type of `sizeof` returns is `size_t`, which represents a size (unsigned value)

```c
size_t size;
int i;
size = sizeof(i);
```

* In this case, we should get `size` assigned to `4`, since an integer is typically 4 bytes (32 bits).

## Type Modifiers

* We may want to modify the amount of storage used by a type.
* This enables data to use more or less memory depending upon the use case.
* Adding a modifier of `long` will make the type use more memory
* Adding a modifier of `short` will make the type use less memory
* Adding a modifier of `unsigned` will make the type non-negative in all cases (changes the range of possible values
* If you use `short` or `long` by itself, the `int` type is implied

```c
unsigned short int usi;  /* fully qualified -- unsigned short int */
short si;                /* short int */
unsigned long uli;       /* unsigned long int */
```

* The `const` makes a particular variable constant, or unmodifiable.
  * You _must_ initialize the value when you declare it.
  * What's the advantage?
    * You gain additional protections against a programmer making a mistake and modifying a value they shouldn't
    * Also protects against magic numbers - don't put the same literal all over your program. Use a constant to define the value once and use the constant everywhere you need that value

## Simple IO

### Output

* Input is the process of getting information from the user of your program
* Output is the process of presenting/saving information from the results of your program
* For now, all IO we deal with will come from the `stdio.h` Standard Library file.
* Recall our first program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, World!");
  return 0;
}
```

* This will print the following on your screen:

```c
Hello, world!
```

* This is a form of output to the user using the `printf()` function.
* The `printf` function takes an argument, namely the string you want to print
  * This can be a string literal or a C-style string (we'll cover these later)

### Placeholders

* This is great, but what if we want to output the results of some computation?
* We can't type the result into the program directly (that would miss the whole point of having the computer compute something!).
* Instead, we can insert a **placeholder** to indicate we will place the value of a variable in the string
* Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("19+31 is %d", 19+31);
  return 0;
}
```

* The `%d` here indicates we want to print an integer
* These placeholders are called **format specifiers**.
* Here is a list of important format specifiers:

```c
%d   // int (same as %i)
%ld  // long int (same as %li)
%f   // float
%lf  // double
%c   // char
%s   // string
%x   // hexadecimal
```

* You can find a complete list of format specifiers [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/printf_format_string).

### Tabs and Newlines

* We need to tell `printf` when we want to actually print whitespace
* For instance, suppose we wanted the following output:

```c
 1905
312 +
-----
```

* We can insert a newline _escape character_ with `\n`.
* All escaper characters begin with a `\`
* To get the output above, we would use the following `printf` statement

```c
printf(" 1905\n312 +\n-----\n");
```

* We can also (more typically) split this over multiple lines

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf(" 1905\n");
  printf("312 +\n");
  printf("-----\n");
  printf("%d", 1905+312);
  return 0;
}
```

### Input

* Similar to `printf`, we use a function called `scanf()` to get basic input from the user.
  * Note: Visual Studio users will need to use `scanf_s()` because `scanf()` is technically insecure due a longstanding bug. You can use `scanf_s()` the same way you would use `scanf()`
* Placeholders are mostly similar to those of `printf`
* However, because we are getting a value from the user, we need a place to store that value
  * Where should we store this value? A variable
* Instead of directly giving `scanf` our variable, instead we'll give it a _address_ to the variable
  * We'll talk more about addresses later (when we learn about pointers), but for now, think of a pointer as the memory location of a variable
* We'll get the _address_ of the variable with the _address of_ operator (`&`)
* Here's an example of getting an integer from the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int a;

  printf("Please input an integer value: ");
  scanf("%d", &a);
  printf("You entered: %d\n", a);

  return 0;
}
```

## Basic Operators

* C supports basic arithmetic operators to help you do math.
* Basic operators include:
  * `+` addition
  * `-` subtraction
  * `*` multiplication
  * `/` division (floating point and integer division depending upon type)
  * `%` modulo (remainder division)

### Modulo (remainder division)

* Remember integer division from elementary school?
* e.g. `7/5` was `1r2` (1 with a remainder of 2) because 5 goes into 7 one time with a remainder of 2.
* When you divide two ints, you only get the quotient (number of times the denominator goes into the numerator).
* Modulo `%` gives us a way to get the remainder from the quotient division.
* Modulo is _extremely_ useful.
  * It lets you add a bound to possible values.
  * For instance, suppose you want to pick a random number between 0 and 9.
  * Let's say you have a `rand()` function that returns a random number between 0 and a really, really big number (say 10000000000).
  * You can do `rand() % 10` and you are guaranteed to get a number between 0 and 9.
  * It doesn't matter how big the number is, the remainder _must_ be between 0 and 9.
  * Otherwise, the quotient increments!

## Exercises (for practice only)

1. Write a C program to print your name, date of birth. and mobile number.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("Name   : Alexandra Abramov\n");
  printf("DOB    : July 14, 1975\n");
  printf("Mobile : 99-9999999999\n");
  return 0;
}
```

2. Write a C program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int width;
  int height;

  int area;
  int perimeter;

  height = 7;
  width = 5;

  perimeter = 2*(height + width);
  printf("Perimeter of the rectangle = %d inches\n", perimeter);

  area = height * width;
  printf("Area of the rectangle = %d square inches\n", area);

  return 0;
}
```

3. Write a C program that accepts two integers from the user and calculate the product of the two integers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int x, y, result;
  printf("\nInput the first integer: ");
  scanf("%d", &x);
  printf("\nInput the second integer: ");
  scanf("%d", &y);
  result = x * y;
  printf("Product of the above two integers = %d\n", result);
}
```

4. Write a C program to convert specified days into years, weeks and days.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int days, years, weeks;

  days = 1329;

  // Converts days to years, weeks and days
  years = days/365;
  weeks = (days % 365)/7;
  days = days - ((years*365) + (weeks*7));

  printf("Years: %d\n", years);
  printf("Weeks: %d\n", weeks);
  printf("Days: %d \n", days);

  return 0;
}
```
