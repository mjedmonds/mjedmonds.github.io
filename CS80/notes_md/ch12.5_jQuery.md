## Chapter 12.5: jQuery

CS 80: Internet Programming

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

## jQuery

- A lightweight javascript library
- Main advantage: provides a lot of functionality in a minimal amount of code
  - Works across browsers and platforms
  - Means you don\'t have to worry about minor differences between browsers
- Makes practical javascript much easier

## Importing jQuery

- jQuery is hosted by many large companies

  ```html
  <!-- import your own local jQuery -->
  <script src="jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script>
  <!-- import Google's hosting of jQuery -->
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  ```

## jQuery Basics

- Conceptual starting points
  - We will *select* HTML elements and then perform some *action* on the elements
  - Basic syntax:

  ```javascript
  $(selector).action()
  ```

  - `$` indicates we are using jQuery
  - `( selector )` finds corresponding HTML elements
  - `action()` performs some action on the elements

## Anonymous Functions

- Anonymous functions are functions without a name
- We had subtly been using anonymous functions when we assigned variables to functions
- Remember:

  ```javascript
  // javascript anonymous function declaration
  var sum2 = function(a,b){
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

## Anonymous Functions

- Remember:

  ```javascript
  // javascript anonymous function declaration
  var sum2 = function(a,b){
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

- The right hand side of this assignment has no name!
- We\'ll be seeing this pattern more, don\'t freak out!

## Document Loading

- Previously, we used the following paradigm to wait until the page is ready:

  ```javascript
  // wait for document to load to run the start function
  window.addEventListener("load", start, false);

  function start(){
    // startup code
  }
  ```

- jQuery makes this a lot easier...

  ```javascript
  // equivalent to adding an event listener for when document is loaded
  $( document ).ready(function() {
    // startup code
  }); //notice the syntax of this, we are passing an anonymous function as a parameter! (see the ");" ending the parameter
  ```

## Document Loading

- What does this do?
  - `$(document)` Selects the document
  - `.ready()` is a a jQuery event
  - The anonymous function is the callback to call when the event is trigger
  - Notice how similar this is to what we did before, but with much simpler code
    - We didn\'t have to register a listener for the page loading, then define another function for the start of the DOM interaction.
    - jQuery does this in one step!

## jQuery Selectors

- `*` - select all
- `#id` - select id `id`
- `.class` - select CSS class `class`
- `ele` - select all HTML `ele` elements
- You can also use comma separated values to select multiple selectors
    - E.g. `.class1,.class2` will select both `.class1` and `.class2`
- See: <http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp>

## Old Example: [`loading_event_listeners.html`](../examples/ch12_dom/loading_event_listeners.html)

```{include=../examples/ch12_dom/loading_event_listeners.html}
```

## Exercise

- How can we achieve the same with jQuery?
- Hint: you have the `.mouseenter()`, `.mouseleave()`, `.attr()`, and `.removeAttr()` jQuery actions

## Example: [`highlighting_mouse.html`](../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse.html)

```{include=../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse.html}
```

## Exercise

- How would we do this with anonymous functions?

## Example: [`highlighting_mouse_anon.html`](../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse_anon.html)

```{include=../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse_anon.html}
```

## Exercise

- But this is not very resuable
- Why?

## Exercise

- But this is not very resuable
- Why?
  - We can\'t make `#p1` a variable!
  - And cannot easily highlight other IDs
- Fix?

## Example: [`highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html`](../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html)

```{include=../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html}
```

## Example: [`highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html`](../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html)

- This is a good example of how to modularize and expand a simple example into a reusable segment of code

## jQuery Animation

- jQuery can animate CSS property changes!
- The property changes must be numerical (e.g. cannot animate `background-color: red`)
- The properties are contained in a set of curly braces like so (this data format is called JSON, which we will cover later):

  ```css
  { css-prop1: value, css-prop2: value }
  ```

## Exercise

- Write an animation to change a box\'s hieght and width to 300px when the user\'s mouse enters the box. The box should start at 100px by 100px and return to that size when the mouse leaves

## Example: [`animation.html`](../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/animation.html)

```{include=../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/animation.html}
```
